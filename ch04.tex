\emph{Encodings} \textsf{TM} input is always a string. Need to represent other objects as strings. Same as ``serialization'', e.g. JSON. If we have an object $O$ (e.g. a graph) then $\encoding{O}$ represents it as a string. Assume TMs can do serialization.

We can also represent TMs as strings.

\begin{equation*}
    HALT_{\text{TM}} = \set{\encoding{M, w}: M \text{ is a TM, } w \in \Sigma^* \text{, and } M \text{ halts on input} w} \tag{The Halting Problem}
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
    A_{\text{TM}} = \set{\encoding{M, w}: M \text{ accepts } w}
\end{equation*}

What strings are in $A_{\text{TM}}$!

\begin{itemize}
    \item If $x$ is of form $\encoding{M, w}$
\end{itemize}
