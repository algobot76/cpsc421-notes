\emph{Encodings} \textsf{TM} input is always a string. Need to represent other objects as strings. Same as ``serialization'', e.g. JSON. If we have an object $O$ (e.g. a graph) then $\encoding{O}$ represents it as a string. Assume TMs can do serialization.

We can also represent TMs as strings.

\begin{equation*}
    HALT_{\text{TM}} = \set{\encoding{M, w}: M \text{ is a TM, } w \in \Sigma^* \text{, and } M \text{ halts on input} w} \tag{The Halting Problem}
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
    A_{\text{TM}} = \set{\encoding{M, w}: M \text{ accepts } w}
\end{equation*}

What strings are in $A_{\text{TM}}$!

\begin{itemize}
    \item If $x$ is of form $\encoding{M, w}$
\end{itemize}

\section*{Lecture 16: Undecidability of ATM}

$A$ =  statement on the left is False. $B$ = statement on the right is True. If $A$ is true $\Rightarrow$ B is false $\Rightarrow$ $A$ is false.

$\set{0, 1}^* = \set{\epsilon, 0, 1, 00, 01, \ldots}$ countable

$B = \set{0000\ldots, 111\ldots, 010101\ldots}$

Why not apply diagonalization to $\set{0, 1}^*$?

We need to define $a_n$. Each row $f(n)$ has finite length. If $f(n)$ has finite length $\geq n$, then $a_n$ is undefined.

$2^{\Sigma^*}$ is uncountably infinite.

There are many TMs

\begin{description}
    \item $\Rightarrow$ countably many decidable many languages (each decided by some TM)
    \item $\Rightarrow$ countably many recognizable languages (each recognized by some TM)
\end{description}
